The goal of this assembler is to eventually not be simply an M68K
assembler, but to be relatively easily retargetable.  Also, this
assembler should be callable from other CL applications, as well as
executable as a stand-alone program.


Things to add in the grammar/parser/lexer:

Support for ' (single ASCII character?) -- only because the
	book I have says it's part of Motorola's standard.  Should it
	behave like double-quotes or what?
Support for floats (once FPU instructions are supported).
Line continuations with "\".
Literate input.


Things to add in the assembler:

Verify that BSS contains only zeros.
Checking ranges of types, signed indices, etc.
	Also, type checking information stored in the symbol table.
Output listings (with cycle counts, et cetera).
Add better PC-relative stuff (.+6 or *+42 notation f.ex).
Support for later chips in the m68k line, and enabling/disabling
	allowance of their added instructions.
Change lookup tables so that on load, they get converted to hash
	tables or whatever's appropriate.
Nifty local labels a-la GNU as or similar.  (0f, 1b, etc)
CL-style macros?  (that would be cool!)
Debugger info.
Output in object formats other than A.OUT.
Optimizations/data flow analysis.


THINGS TO DO BEFORE RELEASE

- remove debugging output.
- add a decent warning/error display and logging system.
- compile list of known issues, try to resolve.
- start converting improvised list structure into real structures or
  objects.
- put together a basic automated test suite.
  (once object format has settled down, start a set of regression files,
   with sane output verified by hand.)
- skim all XXXs.
- once a better warning system is in place, allow routines like
MODIFIER-BITS to guess the size of underspecified operations, and warn
about them at suitable warning levels.
- test with sourcer68 output of various files.
- Things to test about relocation:
	are 8-bit indirect displacements being relocated correctly?
	verify all possible relocation combinations.	
- Update dependencies in ASDF file so that it compiles without warnings.



KNOWN ISSUES

- macro parameters are broken.  At least, <foo> style ones are still
  broken.  [assembler]
- no checking of vconstraints yet. [codegen]
- DC.B should handle strings properly (right now it will probably only
  write out the last byte). [assembler]
- Unfinished pseudo-ops:
	EQUR
	DCB
	END
	IFxx
- branch-displacement-bits will behave badly in some unusual situations.
- data segment relocations are unsupported.


KNOWN MAJOR INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH DEVPAC

These are things which aren't likely to change soon.

Macros:

- we don't support < or > embedded in macro parameters which are
  already wrapped in < and >.  (eg: "<foo>>>>2>" => "foo>>2") [lexer]


ENHANCEMENTS FROM DEVPAC

- We support EXTERN/GLOBAL as synonyms for XREF/XDEF,
  respectively.  Also ALIGN as a simple version of CNOP.
