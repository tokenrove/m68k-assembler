The goal of this assembler is to eventually not be simply an M68K
assembler, but to be relatively easily retargetable.  Also, this
assembler should be callable from other CL applications, as well as
executable as a stand-alone program.


Things to add in the grammar/parser/lexer:

Support for ' (single ASCII character?) -- only because the
	book I have says it's part of Motorola's standard.  Should it
	behave like double-quotes or what?
Macro characters -- < > \ @.


Things to add in the assembler:

CL-style macros?  (that would be cool!)
Checking ranges of types, signed indices, etc.
Support for later chips in the m68k line, and enabling/disabling
	allowance of their added instructions.


Things to add in the linker:

uh, the whole linker. ;-)
Atari ST bootfloppy target.
Atari ST PRG target.
linker scripts.
